# Callbacks in JavaScript Exercise Questions

These exercises are based on the lecture on callbacks in JavaScript.

1. Write a callback function that logs "Callback executed!" when called.

2. Create a function that takes a callback and a number as arguments and calls the callback after the specified number of milliseconds.
