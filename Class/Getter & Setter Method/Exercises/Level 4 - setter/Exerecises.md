**Exercise 1**
Create a `Person` class with a `set age` method. Ensure that the age is a positive integer and set it.

**Exercise 2**
Create a `Rectangle` class with `set width` and `set height` methods. Make sure that the width and height are positive numbers, and update the area accordingly.

**Exercise 3**
Build a `Temperature` class with a `set temperature` method. Validate that the temperature is within a specific range (e.g., between -100 and 100 degrees Celsius) and set it.

**Exercise 4**
Create a `BankAccount` class with a `set balance` method. Ensure that the balance cannot be set to a negative value, and update it accordingly.

**Exercise 5**
Develop a `Product` class with a `set discount` method. Ensure that the discount is a percentage (between 0 and 100) and set it.

**Exercise 6**
Build a `Student` class with a `set name` method. Ensure that the name is a non-empty string and set it.

**Exercise 7**
