**Exercise 1:**
Create a `Person` class with `firstName` and `lastName` properties. Implement getter and setter methods for both properties.

**Exercise 2:**
Create a `Circle` class with a `radius` property. Implement a getter method for `radius` and a setter method for `radius` that ensures it's always a positive number.

**Exercise 3:**
Create a `BankAccount` class with a `balance` property. Implement a getter for `balance` and a setter for `balance` that ensures it's not set to a negative value.

**Exercise 4:**
Create a `Temperature` class with `celsius` and `fahrenheit` properties. Implement getters and setters for both properties, ensuring they stay synchronized (changing one updates the other).

**Exercise 5:**
Create a `Student` class with a private `_grades` property (an array of numbers). Implement a getter for `grades` and a setter for `grades` that only allows adding valid grades (between 0 and 100).

**Exercise 6:**
Create a `Product` class with a `price` property. Implement a getter for `price` and a setter for `price` that ensures it's not set to a negative value.

**Exercise 7:**
Create a `Rectangle` class with `width` and `height` properties. Implement a getter for `area` that computes and returns the area of the rectangle.

**Exercise 8:**
Create a `Person` class with a private `_age` property. Implement a getter for `age` and a setter for `age` that ensures it's a positive integer.

**Exercise 9:**
Create a `Book` class with `title` and `author` properties. Implement getter and setter methods for both properties.
