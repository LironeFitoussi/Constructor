# jQuery Implementation Exercise

**Objective:** In this exercise, you will create a basic webpage and implement jQuery in different ways, including using a CDN (Content Delivery Network) and downloading jQuery files locally.

## Instructions

1. **Set Up Your Project Structure:**
   - Create a new folder for this exercise and name it "jQuery-Exercise."
   - Inside this folder, create the following files: `index.html`, `local-jquery.html`, and `cdn-jquery.html`.

2. **Create a Basic Webpage:**
   - Open the `index.html` file in a text editor.
   - Create a basic HTML5 structure with a `<head>` and `<body>` section.
   - Inside the `<body>`, add a `<div>` with an `id` of "content."

3. **Local jQuery Implementation:**
   - Open the `local-jquery.html` file in a text editor.
   - Create a basic HTML5 structure.
   - In the `<head>` section, include a `<script>` tag to load the jQuery library from a local file. You can download jQuery from the [jQuery website](https://jquery.com/download/).
   - Create a `<script>` section at the end of the `<body>` to write JavaScript code that uses jQuery to do the following:
     - Select the `<div>` with the `id` "content."
     - Change its text content to "jQuery was loaded locally!"

4. **CDN jQuery Implementation:**
   - Open the `cdn-jquery.html` file in a text editor.
   - Create a basic HTML5 structure.
   - In the `<head>` section, include a `<script>` tag to load the jQuery library from a CDN (Content Delivery Network). You can use the Google CDN or other CDNs.
   - Create a `<script>` section at the end of the `<body>` to write JavaScript code that uses jQuery to do the following:
     - Select the `<div>` with the `id` "content."
     - Change its text content to "jQuery was loaded from a CDN!"

5. **Test Your Webpages:**
   - Open your web browser and test the following:
     - Open `index.html` to see your basic webpage.
     - Open `local-jquery.html` and ensure that jQuery loads from the local file and updates the content of the `<div>`.
     - Open `cdn-jquery.html` and verify that jQuery loads from the CDN and updates the content of the `<div>`.

6. **Submission:**
   - Compress the "jQuery-Exercise" folder into a ZIP file.
   - Submit the ZIP file for evaluation.

**Note:** Make sure to provide clear comments and labels in your HTML and JavaScript code to explain what you are doing at each step. This exercise will help you understand how to implement jQuery in different ways, which is a fundamental skill for web development.
